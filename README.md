# M244-Final-JVM
Math 244 final project, Julia/Mia/Vishnu


In this project, we explored the feasibility of building a predictive model to estimate a player's plus-minus score in college Ultimate Frisbee based on individual game statistics: turnovers per game, defensive blocks per game, and assists per game. We implemented three distinct regression models—Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression—to evaluate how well these features could predict the target outcome.


All relevant exploratory results can be found in the EDA folder of the repo. The final project report can be found in the report folder of the rpeo.
